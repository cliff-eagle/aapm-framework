# Negotiation Collapse Recovery Protocol

> Handling Tier 3 interaction breakdowns where the authority NPC terminates the conversation.

## What Is a Negotiation Collapse?

A Tier 3 interaction "collapses" when the authority NPC determines that the learner's communicative performance has fallen below the minimum threshold for the interaction to continue. This is the highest-stakes communicative failure in the AAPM.

### Collapse Triggers

| Trigger | Example |
| ------- | ------- |
| Repeated register violation | Using informal speech with a formal authority |
| Cultural norm violation (high-severity) | Violating power distance or face norms |
| Complete communication failure | 3+ consecutive turns without conveying meaning |
| Inappropriate affect under pressure | Aggressive or dismissive responses to authority |
| Linguistic collapse | Complete reversion to L1 under pressure |

## Recovery Sequence

### Phase 1: Immediate Companion De-escalation (0-30 seconds)

When the authority NPC terminates the interaction, the Companion is **immediately summoned with an in-narrative reason**:

> _"Hey, I just heard what happened. Let's get some air. These things happen — I've seen it before."_

The Companion:

- Validates the learner's emotional state
- **Does not analyze what went wrong** (too soon)
- Offers a walk-and-talk to decompress
- Shifts to a low-pressure Tier 1 conversation

### Phase 2: Post-Session Debrief (Next session start)

At the start of the **next session**, the Companion runs a structured debrief:

1. **Replay the key moment** — "Do you remember when you said X to [authority]?"
2. **Explain the NPC's perspective** — "In [culture], when someone of [authority's role] hears that register, they interpret it as..."
3. **Identify the specific skill gap** — Register awareness, cultural norm, vocabulary, or pragmatic strategy
4. **Practice the corrected approach** — Roleplay the same situation with the Companion standing in

### Phase 3: Graduated Re-Exposure

The system plans a graduated return to Tier 3:

| Step | Activity | Pressure Level |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- |
| 1 | Companion roleplay of similar scenario | Low |
| 2 | Tier 2 NPC interaction with same register/cultural context | Medium |
| 3 | Different Tier 3 authority in a lower-stakes scenario | Medium-High |
| 4 | Retry the original Tier 3 scenario | High |

Each step requires minimum proficiency thresholds before advancing.

### Phase 4: Reputation Repair

After a collapse:

- The authority NPC's reputation score drops to its minimum
- Other NPCs in the same social network receive a **reduced reputation penalty** (word travels)
- Reputation can only be repaired by **demonstrating the specific skill that caused the collapse**
- The system creates forward injection directives targeting the collapse cause

## Design Principles

1. **Never punish — only teach.** Collapse is the most powerful learning moment.
2. **Companion first, curriculum second.** Emotional recovery precedes instructional intervention.
3. **Graduated re-exposure.** The learner must rebuild confidence through progressively harder contexts.
4. **Authentic consequences.** Reputation damage is real but repairable — mirroring real-world social dynamics.
5. **Forward injection priority.** Collapse targets are automatically promoted to `immediate` priority.

## Cold-Start Safeguards

Tier 3 scenarios include safeguards to prevent premature collapse:

| Safeguard | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Warning signals | Authority NPC shows discomfort before collapsing |
| Companion pre-brief | Companion offers cultural/register tips before Tier 3 entry |
| Pressure ceiling | First Tier 3 session caps pressure at 70% of maximum |
| Escape hatch | Learner can request a "pause" via Companion mid-negotiation |
