# The Three-Tier Architecture

> A deep dive into the AAPM's three qualitatively distinct interaction environments.

---

## Overview

The three tiers are **not difficulty levels**. They are fundamentally different social environments that require different modes of sociolinguistic engagement.

```
Tier 1: THE COMPANION
  "I'm learning with a friend who believes in me"
       ↓
Tier 2: THE IMMERSION
  "I must communicate to survive in this world"
       ↓
Tier 3: THE NEGOTIATION
  "I must perform at the highest level to achieve my goal"
```

## Tier 1: The Affective Scaffold — The Companion

### Purpose

Reduce the Affective Filter. Build the learner's L2 identity. Create a safe psychological foundation for all subsequent learning.

### Architecture

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **NPC Type** | Bilingual Personal Companion |
| **Language Policy** | Bilingual — L1 permitted, managed via Code-Switching Gradient |
| **Failure Mode** | No failure — recast and continue |
| **Primary Goal** | Confidence building & vocabulary activation |
| **Psychological Register** | Safe, affirming, low pressure |
| **Success Metric** | Connection depth + Code-Switch Reduction rate |
| **NPC Memory** | Deep personal memory across all sessions |

### Key Mechanisms

#### Code-Switching Gradient

```
Session 1-5:   ████████░░  ~80% L1, 20% L2
Session 6-15:  ██████░░░░  ~60% L1, 40% L2
Session 16-30: ████░░░░░░  ~40% L1, 60% L2
Session 31-50: ██░░░░░░░░  ~20% L1, 80% L2
Session 51+:   ░░░░░░░░░░  ~5% L1, 95% L2 (L1 only for novel concepts)
```

#### Dynamic Scaffolding

The Companion provides vocabulary through natural conversational means:

- **Recasting**: Reformulating the learner's error within the flow
- **Clarifying questions**: "Oh, you mean the [target word]?"
- **Contextual embedding**: Describing what the learner couldn't name as part of conversation
- **Celebration**: Acknowledging successful L2 production

#### Relationship Persistence

The Companion remembers:

- Personal details the learner has shared
- Previous struggles and celebrations
- Upcoming Tier 2/3 challenges
- The learner's emotional state trends

### Implementation Notes

- Maximum patience — infinite wait for learner response
- Proactive scaffolding when learner stalls (>3 seconds)
- Never corrects grammar explicitly during conversation
- Systematic errors extracted for Macro-Loop processing only
- Check-ins about Tier 2/3 preparation

## Tier 2: The Functional Simulator — The Environment

### Purpose

Create consequential communication. The learner must actually USE L2 to achieve concrete objectives. Failure has social consequences that must be repaired.

### Architecture

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **NPC Type** | Monolingual Daily-Life NPCs |
| **Language Policy** | L2 Only — no translation available |
| **Failure Mode** | Social Friction Event (persistent, repairable) |
| **Primary Goal** | Functional communication for daily tasks |
| **Psychological Register** | Neutral, authentic, consequential |
| **Success Metric** | Task Completion Rate across 10 sessions (target: 80%) |
| **NPC Memory** | Neighborhood social reputation |

### Key Mechanisms

#### Consequential Communication

- Botched pharmacy visit → no medication
- Miscommunication with landlord → Social Friction Event
- Successful market negotiation → better deals in future visits
- Must repair friction through subsequent L2 interaction

#### Social Reputation System

An invisible, NPC-internal metric:

```
Reputation Score: -1.0 (hostile) ← 0.0 (neutral) → 1.0 (trusted)

Positive signals:
  + Successful communication
  + Culturally appropriate behavior
  + Returned to repair friction
  + Consistent engagement

Negative signals:
  - Communication failures
  - Culturally inappropriate behavior
  - Brusque or dismissive interactions
  - Abandoning unresolved friction
```

Effects on NPCs:

- **High reputation**: Friendlier, offer help, provide information, better deals
- **Low reputation**: Cooler, less patient, less willing to help
- **Recovery**: Always possible through demonstrated communicative growth

#### Environment Configuration

Defined by Persona Schema. Examples:

- **Footballer**: Training ground, locker room, physio room, cafeteria
- **Maritime**: Marina, fish market, port authority, crew quarters
- **Medical**: Hospital ward, A&E, staff room, patient intake

### NPC Behavior

- Realistic conversational timing (natural impatience after pauses)
- Repeat once if not understood
- Either help find alternative or end interaction on failure
- Vocabulary and register culturally authentic to environment
- No L1 support — realistic immersion

## Tier 3: The Hegemonic Negotiator — Professional Power Dynamics

### Purpose

Develop sociolinguistic performance under maximum authentic pressure. Not just communication — strategic goal achievement through culturally precise linguistic performance.

### Architecture

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **NPC Type** | High-Status Authority Figure |
| **Language Policy** | L2 Only + Register Enforcement |
| **Failure Mode** | Negotiation Collapse (offer withdrawn, decision deferred) |
| **Primary Goal** | Strategic objective achievement |
| **Psychological Register** | High stakes, power asymmetric |
| **Success Metric** | Objective Achievement + Register Score (target: 85%+) |
| **NPC Memory** | Professional relationship history |

### The Four Evaluation Dimensions

| Dimension | What's Evaluated | Example Failure |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Linguistic Accuracy** | Grammar, phonetics | Subject-verb disagreements, wrong tense |
| **Pragmatic Appropriateness** | Correct speech acts | Demanding instead of requesting, failing to hedge |
| **Register Alignment** | Formal/informal calibration | Too casual with CEO, too formal with team |
| **Cultural Intelligence** | Behavioral norms | Ignoring hierarchy, wrong meeting etiquette |

### Scenario Types (Per Persona Schema)

**Footballer:**

- Contract negotiation with club director
- Post-match press conference
- FA disciplinary hearing

**Maritime:**

- Yacht owner conflict resolution
- Charter dispute mediation
- Port authority compliance negotiation

**Medical:**

- Patient ethics board hearing
- Credential interview with medical board
- Multi-disciplinary team case presentation

### NPC Behavior

- Maximum sociolinguistic sensitivity
- Tracks register violations in real time
- Reduces openness score on each violation
- Terminates interaction on critical threshold breach
- Professional relationship history persists across sessions
- Previous proposals and commitments remembered

## Tier Progression

Learners don't "unlock" tiers in a linear way. They can access all three, but the system recommends engagement patterns:

```
Week 1-4:  Primarily Tier 1, occasional Tier 2 exploration
Week 5-12: Balanced Tier 1 + Tier 2, Tier 3 introduction
Week 13+:  Primarily Tier 2 + Tier 3, Tier 1 for complex concepts
```

The Companion (Tier 1) never goes away — it serves as a preparation and debrief space for Tier 2/3 challenges throughout the learning journey.
