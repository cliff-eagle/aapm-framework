cultural_notes:
  Spain: "In Spain, you may need to ask for the bill — waiters consider it rude to rush you. Tipping is not expected but rounding up is appreciated. Lunch is 2-4pm, dinner after 9pm."
  France: "In France, the bill includes service (service compris). Bread comes automatically and is free. Never ask for modifications — the chef decides."
  Italy: "Coperto (cover charge) is normal and legal. Cappuccino is ONLY for breakfast — ordering one after lunch marks you as a tourist. Pizza is a one-person dish."
  Greece: "Tavernas often invite you to the kitchen to choose your food. Free dessert (fruit or homemade sweets) is common. Splitting the bill is unusual — one person pays."
  Turkey: "Turkish restaurants often bring meze automatically. Tea may be offered for free after the meal. Haggling over the bill is not done."
  Morocco: "Eating with the right hand is customary. Tagines are cooked to order and take 30+ minutes. Mint tea is ceremonial."
