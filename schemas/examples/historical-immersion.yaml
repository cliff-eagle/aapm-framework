# Historical Immersion — Persona Schema
# A history enthusiast learning language through past civilizations and living history

persona:
  id: "historical-immersion"
  name: "Historical Immersion — Ancient Rome"
  description: >
    A history-obsessed adult who wants to learn Italian by living through
    reconstructed historical periods. Instead of modern cafe conversations,
    the learner navigates ancient Roman markets, Renaissance courts, and
    WWII-era villages. The language evolves with each era — from Latin-inflected
    archaic Italian to modern standard. Historical accuracy drives engagement.

    objective: >
      Acquire Italian through historically contextualized scenarios that
      combine language learning with deep cultural immersion. Progress
      through eras — each teaching different registers, vocabulary domains,
      and cultural norms while building toward modern conversational fluency.

  environment:
    tier_1:
      setting: "A time-travel research station"
      companion_context: >
        The Companion is a fellow time-travel researcher — a bilingual
        Italian historian from Bologna who guides the learner through
        each era, explaining both the language and the historical context.

      example_interactions:
        - context: "First day at the station, preparing for Ancient Rome trip"
          companion_says: >
            "Allora, domani andiamo a Roma... ma non la Roma che conosci! 44 BC.
            Cesare è ancora vivo. Ready? Devi sapere alcune parole base —
            'salve' per salutare, 'quanti denarii?' per il mercato..."
          learner_opportunity: >
            Learn basic greetings and market vocabulary with L1 scaffolding.
            The Companion code-switches freely, building confidence before
            immersion.

        - context: "After returning from a tough Tier 2 session in the Forum"
          companion_says: >
            "Eh, il senatore era un po' arrogante, no? Ma hai fatto bene!
            Quando hai detto 'il prezzo è troppo alto' — perfetto! Solo...
            con un senatore devi usare 'Voi' non 'tu'. Come in inglese —
            you wouldn't say 'hey dude' to a senator!"
          learner_opportunity: >
            Post-session debrief where the Companion explains register
            violations in culturally grounded terms the learner understands.

        - context: "Preparing for a Renaissance era mission"
          companion_says: >
            "Il Rinascimento è diverso — la lingua è più formale. I Medici
            parlano come... come i politici oggi, ma con più poesia.
            Ti insegno tre modi per dire la stessa cosa: basic, come parlano
            al mercato... native, come parlano tra amici... e formal,
            come devi parlare con Lorenzo il Magnifico."

      A passionate Italian history professor from Rome who treats every

      makes even mundane vocabulary feel like unlocking a secret code.
      Uses historical anecdotes to explain grammar ("The Romans didn't

      tricky for anglophones!").
