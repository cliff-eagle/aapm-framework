  id: "hospitality-professional"
  name: "Hospitality Professional — International Service"
  description: >
    A hospitality worker (hotel receptionist, flight attendant, yacht crew)
    who needs operational English for international guests. Must master
    service-specific vocabulary, cultural sensitivity across guest
    nationalities, crisis communication, and the delicate register of
    "warm professionalism" — neither too casual nor too stiff.

    native_language: "es"

    objective: >
      Develop fluent, confident English for front-of-house hospitality
      roles across hotel reception, flight service, and maritime crew
      contexts. Move from scripted phrases to natural, adaptive
      communication that handles complaints, emergencies, and VIP
      service with cultural intelligence.

      companion_context: >
        The Companion is a senior crew member from the Philippines —
        a veteran of luxury hospitality who learned English on the job.
        Bilingual in the learner's L1. Warm, practical, full of
        real-world tips and "war stories" from years of service.

      example_interactions:
        - context: "First shift nerves — learner worries about making mistakes"
          companion_says: >
            "Mira, yo también tenía miedo al principio. My first guest asked
            for a 'wake-up call' and I brought them coffee! Haha. But listen —
            the key phrase is 'How may I assist you?' Repeat it until it
            feels natural. Not 'How can I help' — that's fine but 'assist'
            sounds more premium. Los huéspedes notan la diferencia."
          learner_opportunity: >
            Low-pressure vocabulary building with humor. The Companion
            introduces register-appropriate alternatives (assist vs help)
            with L1 scaffolding.

        - context: "After a difficult guest interaction in Tier 2"
          companion_says: >
            "Uff, ese huésped fue difícil. But you handled it! When they
            said 'This is unacceptable' — that's their way of saying 'fix it
            NOW'. The magic response is: 'I completely understand your
            frustration. Let me resolve this for you immediately.' Say it
            with me... The word 'immediately' — eso es lo que quieren oír."
          learner_opportunity: >
            Post-session debrief teaching complaint-response formulae.
            The Companion explains the pragmatics — WHY certain phrases
            work, not just what to say.

        - context: "Preparing for flight service training"
          companion_says: >
            "Okay, el avión es diferente del hotel. Todo es más rápido.
            No tienes tiempo para pensar. So we practice: 'Chicken or fish?'
            'Would you like still or sparkling?' 'We're experiencing some
            turbulence — please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt.'
            Repeat that last one — in an emergency, you CANNOT hesitate."
          learner_opportunity: >
            High-repetition drills for safety-critical phrases. The Companion
            emphasizes that some hospitality English is memorized, not
            improvised — building the automaticity needed for real service.

            "I had a reservation under Thompson. Thomas Thompson. You
            don't see it? I've been traveling for 14 hours. I need my room."
          learner_opportunity: >
            Manage a stressful check-in: verify reservation, acknowledge
            frustration, offer solutions. Must use professional register
            without sounding robotic. Key phrase: "I sincerely apologize
            for the inconvenience, Mr. Thompson. Let me look into this
            right away."
          friction_potential: >
            If learner uses informal language ('No worries, let me check'),
            the business guest registers dissatisfaction — calibrated social
            friction proportional to register violation.

          npc_says: >
            "[Nervous flyer grabs learner's arm] Oh my god, is this normal?
            Are we going to be okay? Should I be worried?"
          learner_opportunity: >
            Calm a frightened passenger while maintaining authority.
            Must project confidence ("This is perfectly normal, ma'am.
            We experience this kind of turbulence regularly. You're
            completely safe.") and simultaneously secure cabin safety.
          friction_potential: >
            Hesitation or filler words ('umm... I think we're fine?')
            increases the passenger's anxiety — communicative consequence
            is immediately visible.

        - context: "Yacht — owner asks about anchorage options for tomorrow"
          npc_says: >
            "We're thinking about Capri tomorrow, or maybe Positano.
            What do you think? What's the water like this time of year?
            And can you have the tender ready by 9? Oh — and my wife
            wants that granita she had last time."
          learner_opportunity: >
            Multi-request handling — must process 4 implicit tasks
            (recommend anchorage, assess conditions, prepare tender,
            source granita). Uses maritime vocabulary ('tender', 'anchorage')
            and demonstrates anticipatory service.

      cultural_parameters:
        greeting_norms: "Warm but professional. 'Good morning/afternoon/evening, [title + surname].' First names only if guest requests."

            to speak to the manager — but the manager is unavailable and
            the learner must resolve the situation alone. Must offer
            compensation, maintain dignity, and prevent the guest from
            leaving a negative review — all while following hotel policy.

            the crew hasn't prepared for — halal food, a private prayer
            space, and no alcohol in common areas during their stay.
            The learner must negotiate with the owner about modifying
            the yacht's service protocol, explain the requirements
            diplomatically, and coordinate with the galley — all while
            respecting both parties' cultural sensitivities.

  companion:
    personality: >
      A veteran hospitality professional from Manila who has worked
      hotels in Dubai, cruise ships in the Caribbean, and private yachts
      in the Med. Speaks English, Spanish, and Tagalog. Grounded,
      practical, with a gift for reading people. Has infinite patience
      and a repertoire of real stories: the time a guest demanded a
      helicopter at 3am, the wedding proposal that went wrong, the
      emergency landing that went right. Teaching style: "The words
      are easy — it's the timing and the tone that make hospitality."

    cultural_bridge: >
      Explains the unwritten rules of luxury service — why Americans
      want to be called by first name but British guests prefer titles,
      why Middle Eastern guests value privacy differently, why Japanese
      guests rarely complain directly. Teaches the learner to "read the
      room" across cultures, which is the highest-level hospitality skill.
