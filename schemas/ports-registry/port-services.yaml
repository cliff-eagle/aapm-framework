# Universal Port Services — Common buildings at every port
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# These services are auto-generated at every port, regardless of
# whether landmark-specific data exists. Each service has:
#   - A building with country-appropriate architecture
#   - An NPC with a culturally appropriate name
#   - Dialogue context for language learning scenarios
#
# NPC names are per-country defaults. If a port's YAML already
# defines an NPC with a matching role, that NPC takes priority.
